# Format string attack

This repository contains a python script that can be used to craft a string to perform a format string attack in a 32bit system.

## How does the attack work?
A format string attack exploit a memory vulnerability that uses placeholders and unchecked user input to write into the memory. A detailed explanation can be found in the following [slides](https://github.com/alecontuIT/format-string-attack/blob/main/Format%20String%20Bugs.pdf) taken by the computer security course of PoliMi.
